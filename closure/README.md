<h3>Closure and Modules</h3>
- how to create a closure
- the fact the function returned by the closure retains access to
 all the variables that were in the context at the 
 same moment the function was created
- how to create and how to use a module
- module imported with ```require('./md/module1')``` (see the dot)
are modules that are inside the application. Modules imported without
a relative path, like ```require('mysql')``` are modules imported with ```npm 
install --save```
